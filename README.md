# TypeScript Recipe Book

A basic recipe book. A single user can add, delete, and edit recipes, including the ingredients and measurements of their ingredients.

This was an educational project, and an exploration of some technologies I found interesting. My goal was to achieve full-stack CRUD while exploring:

- Data modeling with Prisma ORM
- Next.js app directory and React Server Components
- Full-stack type safety with TypeScript
- Styling and responsive design with Tailwind CSS (coupled with components from [shadcn/ui](http://ui.shadcn.com))
- Uncontrolled input and form handling with [React Hook Form](http://react-hook-form.com)
